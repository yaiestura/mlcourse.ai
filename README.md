<b>mlcourse.ai</b> is an open Machine Learning course by [OpenDataScience](https://ods.ai/), lead by Yury Kashnitsky (yorko). The course is designed to perfectly balance theory and practice. You can take part in several Kaggle Inclass competitions held during the course. From spring 2017 to fall 2019, 6 sessions of mlcourse.ai took place â€“ 26k participants applied, 10k converted to passing the first assignment, about 1500 participants finished the course. Currently, the course is in a self-paced mode. Check out a thorough [Roadmap](https://mlcourse.ai/roadmap) guiding you through the self-paced mlcourse.ai.

The course aims at a perfect balance between theory and practice. Therefore, prerequisites include:

- Python
- Math
- Software requirements
- DevOps

Course consists of 9 Practice Assignments and Kaggle Capstone Project:
